            In India, the poor are always an afterthought. It seems strange, given that it is a country where 
            millions of people live in extreme poverty, but that is how things have always been. And, it 
            wasn't any different on Tuesday night either, when the Indian government announced a nationwide
            lockdown for a period of 21-days to curb the spread of coronavirus.

            So far, some NGOs and companies have shown great enterprise and tried to ease the distress of
             marginalised individuals during the lockdown. Listed here are few NGOs and companies which have
              started campaigns to gather funds for the poor, or organised volunteer services to help elderly
               citizens.
